\[ `HELP v\.1\.0` \]

/help â€” show this very message\.

/channel â€” enter *setting channel mode*\. Before entering this mode you __*have to*__ add this bot to *your channel*\. Also, you __*have to*__ let the bot send new posts\.

Then, in this mode you should forward a message from __*your channel*__ \(*do not forward other channels' posts\!*\) to this chat\. This way bot *will remember* your channel\.

/redir \(_default_\: *on*\) â€” toggle forwarding messages to your channel\.

/media \(_default_\: *off*\) â€” toggle replying to the post with twitter video/gif, if there's one\.

/save â€” the bot will send you the media from the last link you posted, _*except for forwarded messages*_`\*`\.
Maybe I will fix it later, who knows\.

`\*`_*Pro tip*_\: For now, use /redir command to turn off forwarding, *if it's pixiv, also choose illustrations to save*, and then send /save command\.

/style â€” cycle pixiv post styles\. Only *2 styles* are available right now\.

/cancel â€” cancel current operation\. *Use it in cases when you want to shut this bot up*\.

_*Any text message*_ â€” bot will ignore it, unless there's a twitter or pixiv link in it, that could be parsed\.

For now, only *the first one* found will be parsed\.

In any case, *please, don't bully Yaminui\-chan*\! ðŸ’« \~
